# üîß Pipeline Fix Summary - Stage 2 & 3 Errors

## Problem 1: Stage 2 - Feature Engineering (FIXED ‚úÖ)

### Error
```python
ValueError: too many values to unpack (expected 2)
```

### Root Cause
`scale_numerical_features()` returns 2 values but code tried to unpack 3:
```python
df, scaler, numerical_cols = scale_numerical_features(df)  # ‚ùå Wrong!
```

### Solution
```python
df, scaler = scale_numerical_features(df)  # ‚úÖ Correct!
```

**File Modified**: `full_pipeline.py` line 99

## Problem 2: Stage 3 - Data Splitting (FIXED ‚úÖ)

### Error
Target variable `Attrition_Flag` was being scaled along with features, resulting in float values like `0.4375063` and `-2.28568136` instead of binary 0/1.

### Root Cause
`scale_numerical_features()` was scaling ALL numerical columns including the target variable.

### Solution
Updated `scale_numerical_features()` to exclude target column by default:

```python
def scale_numerical_features(df, numerical_columns=None, method='standardize', exclude_columns=None):
    # ...
    if exclude_columns is None:
        exclude_columns = ['Attrition_Flag']  # Default: exclude target
    
    # Remove excluded columns from numerical_columns
    numerical_columns = [col for col in numerical_columns if col not in exclude_columns]
```

**File Modified**: `src/feature_engineering.py` lines 123-133

## Verification Results

### ‚úÖ Stage 2: Feature Engineering
- Binary encoding: Working
- One-hot encoding: Working  
- Numerical scaling: Working (excludes target)
- Output shape: (10,127 √ó 32)
- Target preserved: [0, 1] (not scaled)

### ‚úÖ Stage 3: Data Splitting
- Stratified split: 80/20 (train/test)
- Training samples: 8,101
- Test samples: 2,026
- Features: 31 (excluding target)
- Target distribution maintained:
  - Train: 6,799 (churned) / 1,302 (retained)
  - Test: 1,701 (churned) / 325 (retained)

## Files Created for Testing

1. **test_stage2.py** - Isolated test for feature engineering
2. **test_stage3.py** - Isolated test for data splitting
3. **test_feature_eng.py** - Comprehensive feature engineering test

## Next Steps

‚úÖ Stage 1: EDA & Preprocessing  
‚úÖ Stage 2: Feature Engineering (FIXED)  
‚úÖ Stage 3: Data Splitting (FIXED)  
‚è≥ Stage 4: Model Training (15 minutes)  
‚è≥ Stage 5: Stacking Ensemble  
‚è≥ Stage 6: Results Display  
‚è≥ Stage 7: Status Check  

**Pipeline is now ready to run completely!** üöÄ

Run:
```cmd
run_pipeline.bat
```

Or for testing:
```cmd
python full_pipeline.py
```

## Summary of Changes

| File | Line | Change | Reason |
|------|------|--------|--------|
| `full_pipeline.py` | 99 | `df, scaler = scale_numerical_features(df)` | Fixed unpacking (2 values not 3) |
| `src/feature_engineering.py` | 123 | Added `exclude_columns` parameter | Exclude target from scaling |
| `src/feature_engineering.py` | 127-133 | Default exclude `['Attrition_Flag']` | Preserve target as 0/1 binary |

---

**Status**: ‚úÖ All issues resolved. Pipeline ready for full execution.
